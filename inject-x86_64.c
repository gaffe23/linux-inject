/*
 * injectSharedLibrary()
 *
 * This is the code that will actually be injected into the target process.
 * This code is responsible for loading the shared library into the target
 * process' address space.  First, it calls malloc() to allocate a buffer to
 * hold the filename of the library to be loaded. Then, it calls
 * __libc_dlopen_mode(), libc's implementation of dlopen(), to load the desired
 * shared library. Finally, it calls free() to free the buffer containing the
 * library name. Each time it needs to give control back to the injector
 * process, it breaks back in by executing an "int $3" instruction. See the
 * comments below for more details on how this works.
